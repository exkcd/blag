title: A little poem
description: To the monochromatic melancholic melody I sing in my head

life is looking

a little less colorful.

a little more grey,

a little more time to waste away, and

a little less to say how often I think

about—

the way I used to sing and dance between the stars

because shooting stars are the meteors

that meet my outstretched hand, telling me to take to the sky,

but the comets comment on my inability to fly, and instead

I burn upon reentry.

all I wish for is just to see—

a little more color coated in my cornea

to distract myself from the voices

whispering white lies that lie in waiting

to wash over my guilt and shame like I have done something wrong.

a wrongdoing to outdo what I have already done,

even though I have done nothing wrong, but the voice tells me otherwise.

this is all to say I feel,

a little more tired,

a little more defeated,

and a lot more like I miss—
