title: Goodbye, again
description: To a friend from far away
---

I feel like these recent posts have been inspired by sleep deprivation and those-existential-crises-you-have-right-before-you-sleep thoughts. While that has kept me on my writing game, I do not always want to rely on anxiety and stress to fuel my creativity. I think I'm still in that weird middle ground of knowing how to correctly format a blog post and giving into the string of tangental thoughts. I understand that you cannot force creativity, but at the same time, if I just wait for motivation to strike, I'm not going to get anywhere.

Although I have said that I'm not going anywhere, I am thinking about going somewhere. Specifically a somewhere involving not here. I wanted so badly for this project to survive more for at least a year, but this isn't serving me as something that I want to continue at least for now.

Since I have decided to end this little website, I guess I'm due for an origin story: I started this little website as a way to cope with my first ever breakup as well as deal with the loneliness that followed. I spent a good portion of 2022 deep in depression and a slight identity crisis, trying to figure out who I was without my partner. It was my first ever relationship, and  as much as I didn't want it to end, it ended. Looking back in hindsight, it wasn't perfect. We weren't perfect, but it was good enough for us at that time. However, I don't regret it. I don't regret falling in love and that love breaking me. If I am bound to living this life over and over again, suffering the same fate for an infinite amount of times, I'd do it over and over again. I guess I like the emotion sickness. But that isn't to say that I shouldn't move on. I think it's time to move on.

Since “see you later”  is never guaranteed, I guess “goodbye, again” is the reminder that we have said goodbye before, and we're both here to say it again.

Goodbye, again.


Sincerely,

Me
