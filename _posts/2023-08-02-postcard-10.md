They say nothing lasts forever because everything is subject to the constant motion of change. But I think that Forever Afters are not future moments to be experienced, but are memories that already happened.

I think this will be the last post of my small series of postcards. I don't know if I'll ever do segments like this again (or even revive my dead poetry), but for now I'm just going to let it go for now. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did writing it. <3
