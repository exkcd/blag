description: To the change in tides

I don't know how to put this in better words, but it has felt strange to write. Maybe it's due to my ineloquent vocabulary, or lack of an "audience". Maybe it's due to the standards I hold myself to, or even the length of which these posts should be. Whatever the case, I have felt myself holding back my words and thoughts out of fear of repetition. I've circled around the same topics quite a bit, and one of my fears is the lack of progress I am making with my own writing.

My circumstances haven't changed a lot, but they also have? So many events have unfolded in the months that have gone by, but at the same time, I feel almost  no difference.  I guess that's how change works, right? It happens so subtly that you barely notice the shift in your own tectonics that only in hindsight do you realize how far you've walked, and only in foresight do you realize how much walking you have left to do.

I guess what I'm trying to do is reassure myself that while I might feel stagnant, it's only because I am the observer of my life as well as the one experiencing it. Doing both is quite contradictory, but such is the nature of humanity.

Actually, I would like to add a third perspective. As conscious beings, we also have the privilege  to reflect and ponder our past choices at any given moment in time to help us decide future choices. Right now, I sit at a major crossroad in my life, and over these past few weeks, I have been reflecting over my past, and wondering what this new future will hold (I have also had many existential crises about it, but that's a tangent for later).

If I'm being honest, it feels quite strange to not know where you're headed. Stranger things have happened to me, and stranger things have yet to happen, but I guess in this moment of time, at the time I am writing this, I must ride  these stranger tides.

I guess I'm mainly confused and anxious about everything. For the first time in my life, I don't have a goal for my immediate future nor for a future five years from now. I have never felt so nearsighted before. I'm scared, honestly. Scared of the change that will happen.

Will I recognize myself?

Who will I become?

Will I forget who I am? This version of me?

I don't have these answers, and I may never have them.

But that's ok. I guess, in the end, it will all be ok one way or another. I guess, just for now, I'll be ok with "just ok".
