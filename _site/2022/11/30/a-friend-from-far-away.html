  <p>Whether you happened to stumble upon this by accident, or if you were actively looking for this particular page, hello there! I’m not sure what this will entail, but I guess that’s the exciting part about starting something new. This project was mainly a way for me to introduce myself to website development, and to get better at writing. At most, I want this to be a place where you can read and get lost in thought with me. I envision this as a small little attic where I can store my thoughts about life, the universe and everything. You can join me if you’d like. If you don’t want to stay, I don’t mind. You can leave at any point in time, I won’t be offended. I’m really doing this for myself so that one day I can look back and reread everything I’ve written and seen how far I have come. I’m a half-baked writer at best. My grammar is subpar, I don’t have an innate sense for storytelling, and my mind will go on tangent after tangent. Yet I believe that the only way I can get better at writing is to actually start writing to an audience, even if I don’t know if anyone’s listening (or reading? I guess that’s a more correct term).</p>

<p>I don’t expect this to become much of anything. In fact, I really don’t want it to become something. For me, there’s comfort in anonymity and not knowing. I guess that’s because if you don’t know something, you can always use your imagination, and there’s nothing anyone can do to tell you if it’s true or false. I also like the fact that I don’t know you  and you don’t know me. If you do happen to know me and our lives have intertwined in this weird little way, you can keep this a little secret. It helps keep this little space protected, so come and go as you please. My only hope for you is that if you do happen to stumble upon this little website that you can get something out of my rants and rambles. I know I’m not the most fluid in my writing. It’s more sporadic and jagged if I’m being honest, yet despite that I hope I can add a little smile to your day.</p>

<p>If you’ve made it this far into this “letter”, yay! I’m glad you took the time out of your day to grant me a voice even if it is a small one. I named this website “Letters to a far away friend” because I like to imagine this as simply that, a letter to a far away friend. I like to imagine this getting addressed, stamped and delivered to a friend that I have not seen in years, and I like to imagine this as an old friend catching up with me. I don’t know about you, but there is this sort of comforting yet exciting feeling about getting a letter. It makes me feel special, like how a friend took the time out of their day to write a thoughtful and provoking letter to me, a very insignificant person in the grand scheme of life, yet to them I’m somehow important. I don’t know about you, but I like being important even if that is to only one person. Maybe I can be important to you, too.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening to me, for carving out time in your day to make room for me. I hope that you got something out of this even if it is just the thought of “this person is terrible at writing”. I hope you stay for a while, and I hope that you enjoy this little time as much as I do writing it.</p>
